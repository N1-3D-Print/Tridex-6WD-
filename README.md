# Tridex-6WD

6WD Tridex – Full CAD Release

This repository contains the full CAD files of my custom 6WD Tridex (CoreXY AWD hybrid) project.

The concept combines a Tridex-style IDEX layout with a 6-wheel-drive motion system, focused on high acceleration, drivetrain rigidity and experimental high-speed performance setups.

# Motion System

The drivetrain is designed around six NEMA17 stepper motors for the XY AWD configuration.

All six drive motors are intended to be standard NEMA17 format (1.8°), making the system compatible with widely available high-performance stepper options.

The AWD base concept originates from the LDO Motors AWD CNC system, which served as the mechanical foundation for this build.

Official AWD gantry reference:

This project integrates that AWD concept into a Tridex-style architecture and extends it into a custom 6WD configuration.

# Part Cooling

Each toolhead runs an independent CPAP-based part cooling system.

For this build, I used the BIQU Universal Turbo Kit (CPAP solution):

Both toolheads are equipped with separate CPAP blowers to ensure high and consistent airflow at extreme print speeds.

has not been validated for long-term reliability

This repository is meant as a reference and inspiration platform, not a finished kit.

If you build from it, you do so at your own responsibility.
