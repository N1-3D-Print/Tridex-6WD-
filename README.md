# Tridex-6WD

6WD Tridex – Full CAD Release

This repository contains the full CAD files of my custom 6WD Tridex (CoreXY AWD hybrid) project.

The concept combines a Tridex-style IDEX layout with a 6-wheel-drive motion system, focused on high acceleration, drivetrain rigidity and experimental high-speed performance setups.

AWD System

For the all-wheel-drive implementation, I used the LDO Motors AWD CNC system as the mechanical and drivetrain foundation in my build.

The base gantry concept originates from the official LDO AWD repository:

👉 https://github.com/VCProjects/LDO_AWD

This project represents my integration of that AWD gantry into a Tridex-style architecture and its expansion into a custom 6WD configuration.

Part Cooling

Each toolhead runs an independent CPAP-based part cooling system.

For this build, I used the BIQU Universal Turbo Kit (CPAP solution):

Both toolheads are equipped with separate CPAP blowers to allow high and consistent airflow at extreme print speeds.

What’s included

Complete mechanical CAD

Custom motor mounts and drive layout

Structural frame components

Various experimental design iterations

Important

This is not a polished commercial release.

The design:

is still experimental

may contain imperfections

is not fully optimized for manufacturing

has not been validated for long-term reliability

This repository is meant as a reference and inspiration platform, not a finished kit.

If you build from it, you do so at your own responsibility.

Purpose

The goal of sharing this CAD is to:

Provide a starting point for advanced builders

Document the development process

Encourage experimentation in AWD / multi-drive CoreXY systems
